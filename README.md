# spotify-etl
## Description
ETL process of data obtained from the spotify api, using the Spotipy library, and loading the data to a Mysql database

## Unstuctions
- run "pip install requirements.txt" on the command line, preferably in a virtual environment
- Add the access keys in an .env file
- run the program from main.py

## observations
unfortunately the spotify api does not allow queries with more than 50 data, nor more than a few days ago as of today
